# School_Placement_System
Waec School placement Demo

This program runs with the idea of the GES system, i.e. an administrator inputs a student's data into the system and the program assigns the school for the student per the student's choice and from first choice to third choice. Then the student logs into the system and check the school 
he or she has been placed in.
To run the program, just compile the main.cpp file and Enjoy!
There are some additional files that help the program to run, namely: stud.dat for holding the details of all the students entered into the system,
schgroup.dat which holds all the school data, etc....
Thank You.
